# PyUTM
PyUTM is a Python package that creates UTM (and UPS) grid references from point data.
It can also use those grid references to create spatially meaningful unique identifiers for tasks such as asset naming.
## What is a UTM grid reference?
The *Universal Transverse Mercator* (UTM) projection and grid allows any location in the world to be described by a
string of up to 15 characters. The precision of a location increases as characters are added to its description and
decreases as characters are removed. 

## Installation
To install PyUTM, use PyPI:
```
pip install pyutm
```
*If not already installed, Python 2.7 users will require the [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266).*
